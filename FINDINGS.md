Issue #41 is caused by removing refresh-cache eviction while retaining refresh DBs for the prewarm/closeout cache. Eviction must therefore not run from PrepareFreshContainer, whose contract is to preserve fresh entries, and must allow sessions to outlive the old 24-hour window. The smallest shared fix is a 30-day inactivity TTL at RefreshDBPath, which is used whenever a refresh cache entry is acquired; protect the acquired path during that pass and remove SQLite sidecars with the database so reused/active entries survive while abandoned entries are eventually reclaimed.

## Issue #57 findings

- `internal/cli/cli.go` wires `--include-path` as a regex over project working
  directories, and passes it into `agentproto.SearchOpts.IncludePath`.
- `internal/query.PathPredicate` applies the include/exclude pattern to the
  supplied `cwd` string. `internal/scopes.FilterByPath` applies the same
  predicate to `scopes.CWD(sc)`, never to a session ID.
- The consolidated search path resolves the pattern against stored `(project,
  cwd)` pairs in `agentproto.resolveStoreProjects`; a nonmatching path can
  therefore produce an empty result without identifying that the filter value
  was likely a session ID.
- `rawclaw read <session8>:<uuid8>`, `rawclaw outline <session8>`, and
  `rawclaw --resume <session8>` resolve session IDs/prefixes. There is no
  search or browse flag that scopes a result set to one session ID.
- The minimal fix is an additive hint on an empty path scope when
  `--include-path` looks like a bare UUID/session ID. It should point to
  `rawclaw outline <id>` / `rawclaw --resume <id>` and preserve the existing
  path-filter and JSON-output semantics. `read` is not valid recovery because
  it requires a `<session8>:<uuid8>` message reference, not a session ID.
