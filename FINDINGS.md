Issue #41 is caused by removing refresh-cache eviction while retaining refresh DBs for the prewarm/closeout cache. Eviction must therefore not run from PrepareFreshContainer, whose contract is to preserve fresh entries, and must allow sessions to outlive the old 24-hour window. The smallest shared fix is a 30-day inactivity TTL at RefreshDBPath, which is used whenever a refresh cache entry is acquired; protect the acquired path during that pass and remove SQLite sidecars with the database so reused/active entries survive while abandoned entries are eventually reclaimed.

# Accepted Ponytail Finding 13

Ruling: replace the duplicate hand-rolled `strings.IndexByte` fragment stripping
in `internal/cli/cmd_ingest.go:backingPath` and
`internal/index/containers.go:backingFilePath` with exact-equivalent
`strings.Cut` calls. Keep the two local functions; add no shared helper or
unrelated cleanup.

Estimated net reduction: 4 lines.
