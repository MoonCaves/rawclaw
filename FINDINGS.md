# Ponytail rulings: store stats lane

## Finding #7 — ACCEPT

`internal/store/stats.go:GetCorpusStats` has six independent aggregate queries.
Replace them with exactly two conditional-aggregation queries: one over
`sessions`, one over `messages`. Preserve zero-row counts, `MIN`/`MAX` NULL
handling, the existing zero-stats-on-scan-error behavior, and the public
`CorpusStats` result. Reuse `database/sql`; add no abstraction or dependency.

## Finding #19 — ACCEPT

`first10` only receives documented ASCII ISO timestamps. Replace the rune-slice
allocation with `s[:min(len(s), 10)]`; preserve empty and short-string behavior.

## Scope fence

Only `internal/store/stats.go` and its directly corresponding store stats test
are in scope. No GitHub, graphify, or mailbox state is modified.
